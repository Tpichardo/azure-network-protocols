<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
<br/>

In this tutorial we will use Wireshark to observe various network traffic between two Azure virtual machines, as well as, experiement with Network Security Groups.

<h2>What Is Wireshark?</h2>
Wireshark is a software tool used to capture and amalyze data packets that are transmitted over a network.

<h2>What Are Network Security Groups?</h2>
Network Security Groups are a set of defined rules that control the traffic to and from Azure resources. In our case, the resources are Azure virtual machines. So our network security group will use rules to determine if traffic should be allowed or denied, acting like a virtual firewall for our virtual machines.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop (if using Mac, download Windows App, previously known as Remote Desktop)
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Serve 20.04
